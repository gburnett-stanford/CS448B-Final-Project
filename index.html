      If you're reading this, chances are you've been injured at least once during your lifetime.
      Over the course of a lifetime, the everyday objects that can harm us change as we age. The
      Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, is an organization within the United States whose
      main mission is to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death caused by consumer products. Americans who have been injured
      or died as well as property damage caused from consumer products cost the US more than more than $1
      trillion every year.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      This project utilizes the CSPC's data on injuries and deaths caused by consumer products allowing
      us to take a look at 20,674 Americans who were injured by consumer products in 2020. Let's see which products are most dangerous to different ages.
