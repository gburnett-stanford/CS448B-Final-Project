      If you're reading this, chances are you've been injured at least once during your lifetime.
      Over the course of a lifetime, the everyday objects that can harm us change as we age. The
      <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/" target="_blank">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a>, or 
      CPSC, is an organization within the United States whose main mission is to protect the public
      from unreasonable risks of injury or death caused by consumer products. Americans who have been injured
      or died as well as property damage caused from consumer products cost the US more than more than $1
      trillion every year.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      This project utilizes the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/CHQuery/home.aspx" target="blank">CSPC's data</a> on injuries and deaths caused by consumer products allowing
      us to take a look at 20,674 Americans who were injured by consumer products in 2020. Let's first take
      a look at high chairs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="main">
    <h2>High Chairs</h2>
    <h3> The demographic most at risk with <b class="greenText">High Chairs</b> are <b class="greenText">infants under the age of 1.</b></h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Understanding that this is the most dangerous consumer product to those &lt; 1 years old is just one part of the bigger picture. 
      The other part is utilizing that data in order to reduce the amount of injuries and deaths occurring to better protect the users
      of the products.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Below is a a high chair visualized with the parts of the chair, or hazard patterns, that are most invovled when the injury incident
      occurrs. Hovering over the green circles will bring up a label for what part of the chair the mouse is 
      currently on; at the same time, the table below will have the corresponding location or hazard pattern row highlighted. The table is sorted
      in descending order by Total Incidents and also includes data on Injuries and the Ratio of Injuries to Incidents for each
      Hazard Pattern. Note: The far right point for 'Toy Accessories' is not located anywhere specific on the high chair
      as toy Accessories were located in multiple parts of the chair in reported incidents.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Why this Data <b class="greenText">Helps</b>
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Having this knowledge of which parts of the high chair are the most dangerous allows the commission
      to narrow down the root cause of these hazard patterns and what needs
      to be changed. For example, with the case of restraint systems, the CPSC found that a more stringent standard for labels
      and instructional literature than the existing standard (ASTM F404-15) would further reduce the risk of injuries within
      this hazard pattern.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      If you are reading this article, it is likely you are not under the age of 1, however, this idea of identifying 
      hazard patterns can be applied to all consumer products to make them safer and in turn result in less injuries
      or even deaths for everyone in the US.

    <h2>Beyond the High Chair: Let's Explore Other Products</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Asides from high chairs, what other everyday products do you want to explore? With the drop down
      below you can select the consumer product category to discover what age group is most at risk for
      that product. Previously we saw that 0 year olds, or those under the age of 1, were most at risk
      with high chairs.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      If you're feeling stuck, some of the interesting categories to look at are when a product affects
      almost all ages such as All Terrain Vehicles (# of Wheels Unspecified/off Road), or when a product 
      only affects the young and the old leaving a large middle segment untouched such as Night Lights.
      Feel free to look for similar patterns or anything else you want to.

    <h2>All About You</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In this part of the project we want to make it personal to <b class="greenText">you</b>.
      In the visualization below, there are three dropdowns where you will first select your age,
      then your gender, and lastly the state you live in. It is important to note that the CPSC only
      has data on males and females and no other genders so that is all that we can provide at this time.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Once these are all inputted, a chart will appear with the top 10 most dangerous consumer products
      to you in descending order starting from the top. Your most dangerous product will be written in green right below the bar chart.

      Knowing which product is most dangerous to you can help you to be more careful when using said product.
      It may also be helpful to hear about others incidents through written descriptions to identify patterns
      much like the CPSC does to improve safety and reduce injuries.
